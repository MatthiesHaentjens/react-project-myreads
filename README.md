# MyReads 

MyReads is an app that lets you keep an inventory of all the books you are currently reading, already have read or want to read organized with three corresponding books shelfs. You can change the books between the three shelfs or remove them from the shelf. Additionally there is a search functionality that lets add new books to your shelves. The search is connected to an Api library fetching the available books based on your search terms
